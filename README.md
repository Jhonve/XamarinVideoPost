# XamarinVideoPost
A Xamarin project on Android. Posting video frame to Server and get response.

This project was designed for doing CBIR(Content-based Image Retrieval) on phone.
On Server I used SIFT and CNNIR(ECCV 2016) and return the information of image's positions to the phone.

Create a Xamrain Android Project and then configure the code.
